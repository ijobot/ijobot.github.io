          <p>
            Jocasta has always had a flair for creativity. From an early age,
            you would always find her with her head in the clouds rather than
            her nose in a book. After earning her degree in Global Business
            Studies from Trinity College, Dublin, Jocasta decided that what she
            really wanted to do was learn about the world and everything in it,
            and this wasn't something she could learn about in books.
          </p>
          <p>
            With support from her parents, she travelled the world and began her
            career as a successful social media influencer. Beginning with
            Instagram, before branching out into TikTok, Jocasta became a social
            media sensation, known for her glamourous photos and practical
            lifestyle advice. She has brought her wide array of experience to
            HMJ, where she works as creative director and marketing expert.

          <p>
            Heath is the HMJ Health and Fitness guru. Before taking Instagram by
            storm, Heath began as an active YouTuber, where his myriad Health
            and Fitness channels gained a combined 1.2m subscribers.
          </p>
          <p>
            His most popular channels include "Heath Eats", which is full of
            great nutritional advice and cooking demonstrations, "Heath Heats",
            which chronicles his popular DIY home sauna project, "Heath Beats",
            which is full of fun dance-based workout videos set to fun hip-hop
            beats, and "Heath Beets", a specialist nutrition channel dedicated
            to his favourite superfood - beets!
          </p>
          <p>
            When Heath isn't at the gym or chronicling his fitness journey
            online, he's working directly with our clients to plan fun adventure
            and activity getaways. He particularly specialises in corporate
            team-building activities, where colleagues get to know each other
            and how to function as a team, all while having lots of fun and
            getting plenty of exercise.
          </p>
          <p>His body is a temple, he worships every day.</p>
